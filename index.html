        <p>Cricket is a very fun game. In batting, some times you have to use all your power to hit boundries while some times you have to play with cheek and take quick singles. In bowling you have to pitch the ball correctly an try to get the batsman out, especally in the death overs. In fielding you must take catches and on the boundry save as many runs as possible becauze every run counts. Over all I love doing all of this.
